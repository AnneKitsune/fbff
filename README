====

fbff is a framebuffer/OSS media player using ffmpeg or libmpeg3.
The following options can be specified when starting fbff:

==============	================================================
OPTION		DESCRIPTION
==============	================================================
-z x		zoom the screen using ffmpeg
-m x		magnify the screen by repeating pixels
-j x		jump every x video frames; for slow machines
-f		start full screen
-v x		select video stream; '-' disables video
-a x		select audio stream; '-' disables audio
-t		use time based seeking; only if the default does't work

The following table describes fbff keybinding.  Most of these commands
accept a numerical prefix.  The variable avdiff is used to synchronize
audioa and video streams.  The synchronization is done after the 's'
key or the pause and seek commands.  '-', '+', and 'a' keys can be used
to change the value of avdiff as explained below.
